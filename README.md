## About The Project
<p>WWelcome to the website that I wanted to make come true. This is an application that I will use the most when I need to focus on my programming studies. Move.it was made at a Rocketseat event called Next Level Week and aims to apply the Pomodoro technique and still perform physical exercises</p>

### Built With
I used some web technologies in order to train:mortar_board::
* HTML5
* CSS3
* ReactJs
* TypeScript
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started
It is so simple to install and run this project on your local machine, but you can just go to this [link](https://moveit-next-wheat-zeta.vercel.app/index)
### Prerequisites
You need the Yarn installed in your local machine
  ```sh
  npm install --global yarn
  ```
If you don1t have npm in your local machine, install now:
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Hildebrando-Viana-Matos/nlw_moveit.git

3. Run the development server:
  ```bash
